# NOTEBOOK.md — lab notebook

**Charter:** chronological empirical findings from working on the skills — small
observations that don't warrant a standalone dated note. Newest at the top. Substantial
records go to `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (existing example: the 2026-06-29 audit
worker-model benchmark).

- 2026-07-07 — **openspec CLI gotchas** (hit during the round-2 archive): (a) the spec
  validator requires SHALL/MUST on a requirement's **lead line** — put the normative verb in
  the first sentence, not after a "When…" clause; a requirement only gets validated when its
  file is *updated*, so offenders can hide in specs created by an earlier change. (b)
  `openspec archive` **exits 0 on validation abort** — check the output text, never the exit
  code, and don't chain it with `&&`.
